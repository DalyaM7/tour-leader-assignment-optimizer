# Optimization of Tour Leader Assignments: Problem Summary

## 📌 Overview
- A Singapore-based travel agency launched in 2011, specializing in long-haul leisure packages to Europe and North America.
- Operates in a highly competitive market with thin profit margins and seasonal demand peaks during school holidays.
- Offers guided group tours including flights, hotels, excursions, and meals.

## ❗ Business Challenge
- Assigning tour leaders manually was inefficient and potentially suboptimal.
- The goal was to reduce assignment costs while maximizing customer satisfaction.

## 💡 Proposed Solution
- Develop an optimization model to assign tour leaders to 15 selected December 2012 tours.
- Constraints include:
  - Tour leaders require a minimum rest period of 3 days between tours.
  - Some leaders are ineligible for certain destinations (e.g., visa issues).
  - In-house leaders must be assigned at least one tour per month.
  - Freelance leaders have varying fees per tour.

## 📊 Data Highlights
- Tours range from 10 to 14 days, with destinations including USA, Turkey, Italy, Switzerland, Paris, and Eastern Europe.
- Historical customer satisfaction scores available for 10 tour leaders.
- Tour leader fees range from \$1,100 to \$1,600 per tour.
- Expected group sizes vary from 18 to 50 travelers.

## 🎯 Objective
- Minimize total tour leader fees.
- Maximize overall customer satisfaction.
- Ensure compliance with scheduling and eligibility constraints.
